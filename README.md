## Haikuru (twitter-like app for haikus exclusively)

This project serves as a "playground" for me to practice essential full stack and general engineering skills relevant to my 
current job and coursework.

### List of skills/technologies I have applied or plan to apply to this project

- React (with hooks) -- maybe use Redux for state management
- CSS fluency (particularly w/ flexbox, layouts in general)
- Database design (tables, normalization)
- Create fake data and test it; to simulate behavior of users
- Postgres (concurrency, transactions, jsonb/json data, advanced queries, JS/node interface, RDS)
- AWS: for S3 object storage, maybe for Lambda and hosting with ECS and/or EC2 or fargate
- Docker: plan to containerize frontend/backend/db/etc and use docker compose
- Authentication/authorization using popular services/tech -- e.g. jwt, passport, OAuth
- Perhaps use some pub-sub system (like Kafka) and track database changes with Debezium/postgres
- Implement tests (using something like Jest and/or Cypress)
- Set up routes in yaml using openapi, validate requests; understand HTTP better
- Use web sockets for real-time communication
- Perhaps inject some observability code (like Honeycomb, Grafana) to observer/query the system
- Think about how I could scale this? (utilize NGINX, load balancer, message queues, microservices, etc...)
